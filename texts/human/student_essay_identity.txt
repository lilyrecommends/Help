This is where the full text of the student work would go. You can paste in their essays, creative writing, or any other text-based work. The preview shows just a snippet, but clicking opens the full text in a readable modal.

This preserves your gallery layout while allowing both visual and textual student work to coexist beautifully.

The key advantages of this approach:
1. Maintains your existing design aesthetic
2. No nested scrolling issues
3. Text cards blend seamlessly with image thumbnails
4. Full text is easily readable in the modal
5. You can organize text files in folders just like images

- Add new text cards to the HTML with the appropriate title and preview
- The onclick function handles displaying the full content
