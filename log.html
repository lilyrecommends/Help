                  <div style="margin-left: 16px;">Yesterday was lovely until the end. Read some of Coriolanus' first act and revered the government-as-belly analogy. Tabulated some Italian modal conjugations for practice/refresher. Supervised drama kids. Finished early so spent some time at the cottage where I spoke to and was heartened with hugs by the best: [redacted]. There was never a heartier half an hour. Collected [redacted] and we had ice-cream and leaped over the edge of bus shadows on the way home. Played with the Barbie dream house on the kid-sized fuchsia pull-out lounges and watched cat and riddle YouTube videos before [redacted] returned. Exercised with [redacted] (that's two days in a row now; we are very good for each other).</div>

                  <div style="margin-left: 16px;">"Yesterday, I missed my alarm and rushed to work at 08:30. There were only three children so it was okay. I labeled African, South American, and East Asian maps with [redacted] . I was disheveled — no earrings, oily hair, and the nearest polyester dress — but when [redacted]  returned my telephone to me on the couch after having searched 'dumb', 'poop', etc. to find real places ("The Dumb Post Inn", "Poopoo", "Fartown", "Stinky (Стинки)"), I felt vivified by love for him. And then I was home and exhausted again. I purchased a leather bag made in Italy and black leather Wittner pumps ($10!) from a vintage store. I dropped them off at home, put on the shoes, walked to the Metro where I cut my hair and bought groceries from Panetta. My feet were blistered and sweaty but I napped in bed, anyway, from 2pm to 4pm. I dreamt [redacted]. And then I unglued my lids and felt concave, emptied and hollowed out, missing something infinite. Really missing something. I fought back the urge to cry as I walked to the post office to collect the Kitten D'amour red dress, and then to the laundromat to cut the sleeves off the beige linen wrap dress I had bought on sale from [redacted]  before the haircut. It was hard to take my eyes off the floor. He is always in a dream, sweet or sour, and his name echoes in the alleyway of thoughts, liminal-ly but daily. I canceled the run with [redacted], ordered El Jannah, and then cleaned my apartment before [redacted]  arrived to watch Courier (1986). It was very funny.

This morning, I planned to meet with [redacted] at [redacted] but he canceled, citing a sequence of hiccups. I walked through the Glebe markets to buy one beige porcelain mug — I still miss the mute tan and teal spherical one from New Zealand — two custom-sized belts and a laptop case from the gentle waifish beige bohemian lady who sold me the thick brown waist belt. Crossed the road to Sappho's, purchased Melville's The Confidence Man, K. D. Sethna's 'Christological interpretation' of Blake's Tyger, a very old biography of Napoleon, and a very old two-volume series called, 'Half Hours with the Best Authors'. I found a beautiful copy of Bunyan's Pilgrim Progress which I did not buy because it was $80. I walked up the stairs to look for The Library of America's editions of Whitman or Melville, and when I descended, I saw a man wearing [redacted]'s unprecedently unsavory tan orange pants and identical brown ankle boots identical to [redacted]'s c. 2018. He was [redacted]'s height, slightly beneath me in heeled knee boots. I froze. My heart stopped. [redacted] I wanted to leave but I couldn't. [redacted] I wanted to pay for my books but there were complications with the EFTPOS machine. He stood behind me while the cashier walked back and forth for different things. Time stopped. I paid, the lady bagged my books, he was still behind me, I walked out and pretended to continue looking for potential purchases at the outdoor sale trolly, and I quietly said "excuse me" thrice trailing him before he turned around. It was already awkward. I asked to see the book he had just purchased. It was Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress but from the Everyman's Library series and with a loud orange dust cover. I told him I was going to purchase that book but decided against it because of the colour, and I wasn't sure how I felt about it being in somebody else's arms (said comically). He promised me he would read it cover to cover. I asked him out for coffee in a very girly but sincere manner, he paused for a moment, [redacted]."</div>
