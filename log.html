                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Monday 10th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">Morning. I am seated by the open window, with Charles on the sill, surrounded by a wonderful palette: the flax yellow of my striped mug, lace-edged lamp, and hardcover of the University History of the World as a monitor stand; the gradations of laurel green amongst the tiny Moleskines, all bedding ingredients, and the slip dress drying outside on the balcony; and the rich crimsons of the rug, the ribbon tied around the apartment key, and the blanket draped over this wheely chair. Home is not the loud surprise of beauty outside the Florence-to-Siena bus. Home is here, in the firmament of thoughtfully procured books and furniture, in the lap of which sleeps a knotted cat. Home is established which each glint of the framed family portraits, each rearrangement of the bouquet of dried flowers, light sources, and writing instruments on a slippery silken tablecloth, each exercise of copying by the left hand. As one erects a structure of remembrance, of each moment a brick, with whom they have eaten or read or worked or slept, I too have upstairs a heaven of impressions.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Tuesday 11th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">06:30. Listening to Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto 2. Yesterday was lovely until the end. Read some of Coriolanus' first act and revered the government-as-belly analogy. Tabulated some Italian modal conjugations for practice/refresher. Supervised drama kids. Finished early so spent some time at the cottage where I spoke to and was heartened with hugs by the best: [redacted]. There was never a heartier half an hour. Collected [redacted] and we had ice-cream and leaped over the edge of bus shadows on the way home. Played with the Barbie dream house on the kid-sized fuchsia pull-out lounges and watched cat and riddle YouTube videos before [redacted] returned. Exercised with [redacted] (that's two days in a row now; we are very good for each other).</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Friday 14th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">Close to midday.<br><br>Seated in bed, listening to Mehta's Turandot (1973) with the giant and the queen (Pavarotti and Sutherland, respectively).</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Thursday 20th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">It is 09:08 and I am slightly hungry but too lazy to spread peanut butter on some sourdough. I am in bed. Wearing [redacted]'s white shirt from the Uber home. Excited for that first taste of coffee. Listening to the Gregorian chant Viderunt omnes. Blaring white outside; the sky has never been this bright and cloudless-ly white.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Saturday 22nd</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">Yesterday, I missed my alarm and rushed to work at 08:30. There were only three children so it was okay. I labeled African, South American, and East Asian maps with [redacted] . I was disheveled — no earrings, oily hair, and the nearest polyester dress — but when [redacted]  returned my telephone to me on the couch after having searched 'dumb', 'poop', etc. to find real places ("The Dumb Post Inn", "Poopoo", "Fartown", "Stinky (Стинки)"), I felt vivified by love for him. And then I was home and exhausted again. I purchased a leather bag made in Italy and black leather Wittner pumps ($10!) from a vintage store. I dropped them off at home, put on the shoes, walked to the Metro where I cut my hair and bought groceries from Panetta. My feet were blistered and sweaty but I napped in bed, anyway, from 2pm to 4pm. I dreamt [redacted]. And then I unglued my lids and felt concave, emptied and hollowed out, missing something infinite. Really missing something. I fought back the urge to cry as I walked to the post office to collect the Kitten D'amour red dress, and then to the laundromat to cut the sleeves off the beige linen wrap dress I had bought on sale from [redacted]  before the haircut. It was hard to take my eyes off the floor. He is always in a dream, sweet or sour, and his name echoes in the alleyway of thoughts, liminal-ly but daily. I canceled the run with [redacted], ordered El Jannah, and then cleaned my apartment before [redacted]  arrived to watch Courier (1986). It was very funny.<br><br>This morning, I planned to meet with [redacted] at [redacted] but he canceled, citing a sequence of hiccups. I walked through the Glebe markets to buy one beige porcelain mug — I still miss the mute tan and teal spherical one from New Zealand — two custom-sized belts and a laptop case from the gentle waifish beige bohemian lady who sold me the thick brown waist belt. Crossed the road to Sappho's, purchased Melville's The Confidence Man, K. D. Sethna's 'Christological interpretation' of Blake's Tyger, a very old biography of Napoleon, and a very old two-volume series called, 'Half Hours with the Best Authors'. I found a beautiful copy of Bunyan's Pilgrim Progress which I did not buy because it was $80. I walked up the stairs to look for The Library of America's editions of Whitman or Melville, and when I descended, I saw a man wearing [redacted]'s unprecedently unsavory tan orange pants and identical brown ankle boots identical to [redacted]'s c. 2018. He was [redacted]'s height, slightly beneath me in heeled knee boots. I froze. My heart stopped. [redacted] I wanted to leave but I couldn't. [redacted] I wanted to pay for my books but there were complications with the EFTPOS machine. He stood behind me while the cashier walked back and forth for different things. Time stopped. I paid, the lady bagged my books, he was still behind me, I walked out and pretended to continue looking for potential purchases at the outdoor sale trolly, and I quietly said "excuse me" thrice trailing him before he turned around. It was already awkward. I asked to see the book he had just purchased. It was Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress but from the Everyman's Library series and with a loud orange dust cover. I told him I was going to purchase that book but decided against it because of the colour, and I wasn't sure how I felt about it being in somebody else's arms (said comically). He promised me he would read it cover to cover. I asked him out for coffee in a very girly but sincere manner, he paused for a moment, [redacted]."</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Sunday 23rd</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">[redacted] and I saw Turandot at the Joan Sutherland Theatre yesterday.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Tuesday 24th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">06:45. This business of tweeting has made me 'a dull girl'. I will limit the window of viewing to eating times for now, and then further reduce it to every other university lecture.<br><br>Yesterday I dropped off the  [redacted]'s key to [redacted] and  [redacted]'s. Then, I walked down King St home to try on the purple Alannah Hill dress that had arrived. I cleaned. I tried to read the second book of Chronicles but my neighbor was toiling away on some DIY wood project with his radio on speaker. I caught the bus to  [redacted]. I bought two books from Elizabeth's: A. G. Gardiner's Prophets, Priests, and Kings and Henry George's The Condition of Labour. The bookstore cashier was masked and his eyes handsomely smiled when he checked out my books. He opened the contents page and nodded, asked me how I selected which books to purchase — if the book has a lovely cover and I read two lines which I greatly enjoy, I tend to buy it — and he said, "most people only buy these for the aesthetics" and I replied with something unremarkable. We had that conversation at a leisurely pace while another woman was waiting behind me. I walked to university, read the Bible on the Law lawns while construction workers were riding a lift and surveying the face of the [redacted] building. I bought some Fisher cart pesto pasta and could only stomach half. I washed my hands in the library and borrowed Pynchon's V and Abrams' The Mirror and the Lamp. I searched for Bolaño's The Savage Detectives on Logo's recommendation but they did not house it ([redacted] does). The clouds lured me onto the  [redacted] lawns, where I read Gardiner's first two chapters on Edward VII and G. B. Shaw. I caught the bus home and exercised with [redacted].</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Friday 28th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">Yesterday morning, I cataloged my library and ordered classical opuses. I read some Balfour's and Sargents' chapters in Gardiner, and then listened to one Japanese pop song (Hikaru Utada's One Last Kiss) on rotation for an hour in the sun. We walked back and ate lunch. I caught the bus home, napped, ordered a Big Mac and an iced latte from McDonalds. [redacted] collected me and we drove to the Opera House parking lot (felt very luxurious). There were some eye-catching tunnels en route. The production of the Marriage of Figaro was unbelievably beautiful. They immaculately recreated the golden dawn of Wright's Pride and Prejudice through the reflective wooden glass block windows casting gorgeous piercing shadows across the stage. Ah, there were ceiling bookshelves with coloured hardcover collections and pink velvet bed canopy curtains and long timber furniture and weaved baskets and the muted cream wall and its ornamentation and the petticoat skirts and ostentatiously bright royal dresses — I want to yell, and I wanted to fashion every personal room in homage to that set. I swoon with the imagery still fresh. It was a glorious evening.</div></div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Saturday 5th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">Late afternoon. Seated at Sappho's, after having purchased $80 of hardcovers: Berlin's biography of Marx, Cowper, Lewis Morris, a collection of essays on 'Man, Morals, and Society' by J. C. Flugel, and the Adventures of Robin Hood.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Tuesday 8th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">There is white rain sparkling downward against the red brick wall across my apartment. I'm in bed, listening to Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine.<br><br>Yesterday afternoon, I caught the bus to campus and [redacted] gave me a tour of his office. I came over to "watch Synecdoche New York".</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Sunday 13th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">[redacted] apologized and we walked to the beach and spotted the Hill Man, along with hundreds of children in fluorescent pink vests racing and competing in various activities, their parents spectating from the high wall. We walked home, he taught me constant optimisation and Lagrange and Kuhn-Tucker solutions, and I read King Edward VII and Shaw's biographies from Gardiner to him. We bought some McDonalds on the way home</div></div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Wednesday 12th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">These holidays have been wonderful in solitude. I have risen everyday at 05:00, sometimes a touch before, to fill and burn the percolator; while waiting, redistribute the feathers in my quilt and flatten my sheet set with my palm, drink a glass of raw milk or water, light my Hunter candle, and brush my hair into a ponytail; read for an hour; prepare and devour poached eggs on tomato relish on buttered toast; clean; showered; and dressed. I will add some stretches to this as my muscles atrophy too enthusiastically with the sedentary life of an avid reader and teacher. Last week, I read H. G. Wells' A Short History of the World and now I am continuing Boswell's Life of Johnson. Among other things, I have learnt that there is an orthodox prosody to the Ten Commandments, e.g. "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." I have completed marking, outlined my presentation on ChatGPT for Monday, and hope to select my eight pieces of evidence for accreditation today.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Saturday 15th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">I listened to Bach falling asleep last night.</div></div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>Saturday 29th</b><br/><div style="margin-left: 16px;">A few hours from the last post, I caught the train into Circular Quay. I inspected the rivets of the Harbour Bridge while sitting on the grassy hill beside it, listening to a documentary about its construction: the order of components (top arch, second arch, the plank using a barge), the sixteen workers who died (including one man whose thumb was infected from trauma and died a few days later), the child with a knack for engineering who travelled one hundred kilometers to see the opening (and the lovely Australians who supported him on his pilgrimage), and the political turmoil surrounding the opening with the New Guard member rushing in on his horse to cut the ribbon before the polarising Jack Lang could. I sauntered around the Rocks and admired the heritage surrounding me before it was supplanted with charming nougat, glassware, and homemade cosmetics stalls, savoury aromas flying everywhere. I wore a juvenile pink cardigan and a red satin skirt on top of brown leather bowed ballet flats. I caught the ferry to Manly. The sight of HMAS Canberra and recently commissioned USS Canberra compensated for the blast of cold sticky winds that hammered my limbs for twenty minutes. I was meant to see [redacted] on Sunday but asked him if he was in the city for a stroll. I walked to Manly beach, caught strange shapes, and returned to eat a pork bun and takoyaki at [redacted].</div></div>

I have observed a harrowing time of day, from 2 to 5 in the afternoon, where I am depleted and consequently frustrated. If I nap, which I have been doing for the past few months, then from 5 to 7pm I become even angrier. So, from 2 to 5, I need to stay awake by eating or exercising or reading or emails — anything but approaching the sinkhole that is the bed. I also tend to become a menace or suicidal with delayed breakfast, so that is a priority.</div></div>
